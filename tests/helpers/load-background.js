// Helper to load background.js functions for testing
// This requires the functions to be exported or accessible

// For now, we'll create a mock module that exports the functions
// In a real scenario, background.js might need to be refactored to export functions
// or we'd use a different testing approach

// This is a placeholder - actual implementation would depend on how we structure the code
// For testing purposes, we'll assume functions can be imported or accessed

module.exports = {
  // These would be the actual functions from background.js
  // For now, we'll test them through integration or by refactoring
  note: 'Functions from background.js need to be accessible for unit testing'
};
